# easyDB

## Overview
Easy DB is a project I am working on to learn goLang, as well as gain knowledge on how databases are built. The plan is to eventually have a command line tool that is able to take in a user provided schema for the model, and generate a database for the schema with CRUD functionality via, sql queries, api calls, and possibly streaming.
